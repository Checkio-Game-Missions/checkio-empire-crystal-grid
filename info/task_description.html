        An equal number of atoms, combined in the same way produce the same crystal forms, and the same crystal form
        does not depend on the nature of the atoms, but only on their number and mode of combination.

    First checking phase (link) is not enough and we should improve this process.
    Let's check random slices instead rows.
    Our crystal contains two atoms - "X" (Xenatom) and "Z" (Zorium).
    These atoms should alternate each other in rows and columns.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a slice from crystal lattice as a grid (2D array) of letters "X" and "Z".
    The good grid should have the periodic arrangement by horizontals and verticals.
    If any atoms are repeated, then this crystal is broken.
    For example:
</p>

<pre>
[["X", "Z"],
 ["Z", "X"]] is good

[["X", "Z", "X"],
 ["Z", "X", "Z"],
 ["X", "Z", "X"]] is good

[["X", "Z", "X"],
 ["Z", "Z", "Z"],
 ["X", "Z", "X"]] is bad
</pre>

    <strong>Input: </strong> Atom grid as a list of list with strings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Is a grid good or not as a boolean.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <textarea data-code="python">check_line(["X", "Z", "X"]) == True
check_line(["X", "Z", "X", "X"]) == False</textarea>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    In this mission we will use more complex structure as list of list.
    This structure often use as tables or grids or land maps.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    1 &lt; len(grid) &le; 10<br>
    1 &lt; len(grid[0]) &le; 10<br>
    all(len(row) == len(grid[0]) for row in grid)<br>
    all(all(ch in "XZ" for ch in line) for line in grid)<br>
